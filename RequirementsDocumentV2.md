# Informal description

EZElectronics (read EaSy Electronics) is a software application designed to help managers of electronics stores to manage their products and offer them to customers through a dedicated website. Managers can assess the available products, record new ones, and confirm purchases. Customers can see available products, add them to a cart and see the history of their past purchases.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name | Description |
| :--------------: | :---------: |
| Stakeholder x..  |             |

# Context Diagram and interfaces

## Context Diagram

\<Define here Context diagram using UML use case diagram>

\<actors are a subset of stakeholders>

## Interfaces

\<describe here each interface in the context diagram>

\<GUIs will be described graphically in a separate document>

|   Actor   | Logical Interface | Physical Interface |
| :-------: | :---------------: | :----------------: |
| Actor x.. |                   |                    |

# Stories and personas

\<A Persona is a realistic impersonation of an actor. Define here a few personas and describe in plain text how a persona interacts with the system>

\<Persona is-an-instance-of actor>

\<stories will be formalized later as scenarios in use cases>

# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements

\<In the form DO SOMETHING, or VERB NOUN, describe high level capabilities of the system>

\<they match to high level use cases>

# Use case diagram and use cases

## Use case diagram

\<define here UML Use case diagram UCD summarizing all use cases, and their relationships>

\<next describe here each use case in the UCD>

### Use case 1, UC1

| Actors Involved  |                                                                      |
| :--------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|   Precondition   | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the UC can start> |
|  Post condition  |  \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after UC is finished>   |
| Nominal Scenario |         \<Textual description of actions executed by the UC>         |
|     Variants     |                      \<other normal executions>                      |
|    Exceptions    |                        \<exceptions, errors >                        |

##### Scenario 1.1

\<describe here scenarios instances of UC1>

\<a scenario is a sequence of steps that corresponds to a particular execution of one use case>

\<a scenario is a more formal description of a story>

\<only relevant scenarios should be described>

|  Scenario 1.1  |                                                                            |
| :------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  Precondition  | \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true before the scenario can start> |
| Post condition |  \<Boolean expression, must evaluate to true after scenario is finished>   |
|     Step#      |                                Description                                 |

# Glossary

\<use UML class diagram to define important terms, or concepts in the domain of the application, and their relationships>

\<concepts must be used consistently all over the document, ex in use cases, requirements etc>

# Deployment Diagram
